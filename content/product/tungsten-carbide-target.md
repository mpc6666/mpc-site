Binder-phase WC targets are specifically designed for depositing high-quality and high-purity Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coatings. They are extensively used in automotive engine components, cutting tools, and surface decoration applications.

When used as a doping metal or transition layer material in DLC coatings, these WC targets are crucial for reducing the coating's coefficient of friction, improving internal stress distribution, and significantly increasing the coating's adhesion strength. This effectively enhances the performance and broadens the application range of DLC coatings.
